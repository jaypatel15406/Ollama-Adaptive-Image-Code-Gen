# Ollama-Adaptive-Image-Code-Gen
Python code that leverages a language model (such as LLaMA) to generate images featuring basic shapes in 2D or 3D. The script randomly selects shapes, colors, and areas to create diverse visuals. It continuously generates images based on AI-generated code, validates them, and provides feedback for iterative improvements.
